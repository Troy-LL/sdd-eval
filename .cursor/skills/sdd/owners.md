# Owners

What belongs inside each durable file. Open the heading you are writing. Delete the file the day the job dies, and drop the map bullet the same day.

## README.md

What it is, who it is for, how to run (install, command, config path, port, health), limits operators hit. Exact strings. Library: install + one usage snippet. Relative links to sibling docs.

## docs/architecture.md

Data flow, processes, sockets, replica counts, one line pointing at the schema file in code. C4 context + containers. Where a model sits, which tools it may call, how retrieval is wired — topology, same as any other process.

A sentence you can regenerate from DDL, OpenAPI, or a test does not belong here.

## docs/design.md

Operator or user UI: poll, badges, empty copy, keyboard, retry, backoff, focus. Omit on a headless service.

## docs/eval.md

Gold command and where it writes, sample floor, scrape, metric prefix, alert files. Omit if tests already fail the booleans. Gold stays rigid. Prompt text lives in `prompts/` as code. Dated scores live in `evals/`.

## docs/decisions/NNN-title.md

Title, Status, Context, Decision (“We will…”), Consequences. One decision. Keep superseded files. Map it iff violating it would look right.

## Contract (in code)

The schema. Comments on the types if a field needs narrative. Architecture points. Agents Read the types file.
